Part of the reason I'm starting this blog, now, is because I... develop in Ruby on Windows. There, I've said it.

I know, I know. Don't think I haven't considered switching to a Mac. I have my reasons though (that I will detail someday).

So yes, I'm still trying. And I keep hitting weird problems that seem to take lots and lots of google-fu.

And in the interest of trying to make these issues take less google-fu, and so that *I* have a place I can check to see if I've run into this issue before, I'm going to start posting them.
