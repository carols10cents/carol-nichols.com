Here's the post that <a href="http://andrewcox.org/">Andrew</a> has been waiting for: why I continue to try to develop Ruby in Windows rather than give up and switch to a Mac. Here, in order from least compelling at #5:

<ol>
<li value="5"><strong>I'm more comfortable with Windows.</strong> I know where I need to go to change settings, I'm used to the mental models. Often I find what happens in OSX doesn't line up with my expectations and I get confused. This one is least compelling because I learn quickly; I know I'd get used to a Mac if I used one more than I do now.</li>
<li value="4"><strong>I'm stubborn.</strong> Every time someone says "why don't you just use a Mac?" a part of me wants to stay on Windows just because they're trying to convince me not to.
</li>
<li value="3"><strong>I like a challenge.</strong> Similar but distinct from my stubbornness, every time someone says that developing in Ruby on Windows is hard, I want to see if I can do it.</li>
<li value="2"><strong>The Ruby community doesn't seem interested in supporting Windows</strong>, in part because there aren't very many people trying to use Ruby on Windows. I'm trying to stand up and be counted as a Windows Ruby developer (and starting to try to fix bugs where I can) so that people who would like to get into Ruby but only have access to a Windows machine (or work in a Windows shop) are not just dismissed by the community and told to go buy different hardware (or use a VM) if they want to do Ruby. I think the community is doing itself a disservice by alienating people in this way (and I know that's debatable).</li>
<li value="1"><strong>My company's software (which includes a Rails app) is deployed on Windows</strong> (as well as Linux) and I'm the last person on my team developing in Windows on a daily basis. I feel like I need to be catching compatibility issues as early as possible and have a Windows environment at the ready for debugging any Windows-specific issues that arise. My company has been (and continues to be) sub-par at supporting Windows, and a good deal of our customers use our Windows version. This reason is most compelling because if I was working in Ruby or Rails somewhere that wasn't deploying on Windows, I would probably have a Mac as my primary work machine.</li>
</ol>

There you have it. Go ahead and try to argue with my reasons, but watch out for #4, that one might get in your way ;)
