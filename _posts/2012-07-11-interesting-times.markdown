Interesting Times

So today I put in my 2 weeks' notice at Careerimp-- for a variety of reasons that I'm not going to go into publicly, I no longer think the position is the right thing for me at this point in my career.

So what is the right thing? I don't know yet :D I feel very lucky to be in a position where I can afford to take a few months off, and I feel lucky to be fairly certain that I have several options open to me.

In my first month, my main goals are:
<ul class="bulleted-list">
  <li>Put some focused work into <a href="http://rstat.us">rstat.us</a></li>
  <li>Work on my house (one of my longest-lasting contributions to this world may very well be making this house able to stand for another hundred years!)</li>
  <li>Cook new things that use all the fresh vegetables we're getting from a farm share before they go bad</li>
  <li>Figure out goals for the month after that :D</li>
</ul>

And of course there's <a href="http://steelcityrubyconf.org/">Steel City Ruby</a>! I'll now have the week before the conference to concentrate on making it super awesome, and that I'm definitely excited about :D

Thank you to those of you who have been advising me lately-- you know who you are. <3 You helped make this a lot less scary for me.
